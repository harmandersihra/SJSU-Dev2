# About

Cross platform firmware/software platform written by students, alumni, and
faculty of San Jose State University. Designed for the original purpose of
helping students develop firmware for the SJTwo board, but has grown to be so
much more.

SJSU-Dev2 is an easy to use modern and modular C++ firmware development
platform. With the aim of making the development of embedded applications easier
to build, easier to test, easier to maintain and easier to port ot other
platforms. The target platforms would be RISC-V MCUs, 32-bit ARM
microcontrollers, single board linux systems such as Rasberry Pi, Beagle Bone
black and other.

!!! Warning
    SJSU-Dev2 is still in its beta stages and is still growing as a project. We
    have yet to onboard an ARM micrcontroller that wasn't apart of the LPC line,
    nor have we onboarded a linux single board computer. These are expected to
    be introduced to the platform by the end of 2020.
